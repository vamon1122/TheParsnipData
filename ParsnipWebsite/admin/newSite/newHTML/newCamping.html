        Instead of pissing you all off with another group chat i'm just gonna put all the info on here :P

        <ol class="padding" style="text-align:left;">
            <li>
                I was thinking maybe freshfields because it's a nice beach but I don't know whats around it. It'd be nice
                if there was go-karting or something nearby where we stay so if you have any suggestions, let me know.
            </li>
            <li>We have to be able to get there by train really or coach I guess but I think train is better :P</li>
            <li>Train to freshfields is about £20 per head</li>
            <li>
                Campsite I found is £5 a night so that's gonna be pretty cheap. I don't mind paying more for better
                facilities but it's up to you
            </li>
        </ol>
